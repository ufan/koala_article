Dear Editor,

We are encouraged by the positive feedback from the reviewer. We would like to thank the referee again for the time and efforts invested in reviewing our paper and for his/her careful checking of the details. Considering the comments, here is our reply:

1. Implemented. All atomic symbols are changed to roman font.
2. The reviewer had a misunderstanding about the low statistic of Fig. 9. The figure is based the number of strips rather than the number of events. 
   The difference between the calculated position of each strip (deduced from the peak energy of the elastic spectrum on the strip) and its nominal position in the geometry model (by design) is filled into the histograms in Fig. 9. Thus, the statistics is limited by the number of strips on each recoil sensor.
   To make it more specific, we slightly change the caption of the Fig. 9 to 'Histograms of the strip-wise difference between ....'.

We hope that the paper could be accepted for the publication after these minor changes.

Many thanks for your consideration,
Yong Zhou
