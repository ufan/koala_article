Change List to the Review Comments

# General comments:

I am feeling that the submitted manuscript is somehow like a thesis or a part of a thesis rather than a technical paper. I propose the authors to rearrange the contents generally by selecting only the necessary information to be published. I would also propose authors to rearrange the structure of the manuscript as well.

A: Implemented. The structure of the manuscript was rearranged after having reduced the content. 


# Abstract:

It is not clear what is the Koala experiment. If this is the experiment, it should have a physics goal to achieve, however, it is not described. Please define the KOALA experiment more precisely

A: A statement on the physical goals of the KOALA experiment has been included into the abstract.

You wrote "better than 30 keV" but it should be more precise if it is better. In the abstract, readers do not know the details yet, therefore, if it is just a little better than 30 keV, just write "approximately 30 keV.

A: Implemented (better than 30 keV -> approximately 30 keV). 


1. Introduction:

The first sentence is starting with "A good understanding" but it gives a sort of impressions to be non-scientific. Rephrase the first sentence. 

The beginning of the introduction is somehow confusing. First it mentions the importance of the "nucleon-nucleon" interaction, but suddenly anti-proton appears without any description why involving an anti-proton is important. Readers would like to know why. 

The authors describes that the referred experiments at ANKE and EDDA are recent experiment, however the publication year of EDDA is 2007 which nor quite recent. I suggest to rephrase the sentence.

I found that KOALA is the Key experiment for PANDA Luminosity determination, however, it is not mention in the introduction. Why? In the entire draft, the PANDA experiment is not mentioned, and the introduction gives impression that the KOALA is not related to the PANDA experiment, but the name itself involves PANDA. I think that the result of the KOALA is a crucial input to PANDA, however, it is not mentioned. Please describe more how it is connected to the PANDA experiment.

The second paragraph of the introduction seems to be not very attractive, and I don't understand the importance clearly because the PANDA experiment is not mentioned. First the authors should describe the PANDA experiment a bit, and then the authors should discuss the challenge in the PANDA experiment. Then, it should be discussed how the KOALA experiment can contribute to overcome the difficulties in PANDA. Then the authors should describe the method and the uniqueness of the KOALA experiment.

The rest of the introduction doesn't express either the importance of the KOALA experiment, and the reader may not understand why the KOALA experiment is important. From my point of view, it is due to that the PANDA experiment and the importance of the KOALA for PANDA are not discussed. I strongly propose to reorganize the entire introduction. 

A: The first paragraph has been removed and the connection to PANDA is more clearly expressed to provide the necessary cross section input for the PANDA luminosity detector to reach the required absolute luminosity requirements. This also better motivates the use of proton beams with identical kinematics as antiprotons to commission the detector system.


2. Experimental setup at COSY

General comments: the usage of the term "KOALA" is not clear. In the very beginning of the section, it means "the KOALA setup", but in the subsection 2.1, the reader may understand as "the success of "the KOALA experiment". I propose not use just "KOALA" but to describe "the KOALA setup" or "the KOALA experiment" precisely.

A: Implemented. The term ‘the KOALA setup’ (the hardware) or ‘the KOALA experiment’ (also including the physics goals) is now used throughout the paper.

2.1. Hydrogen cluster jet target

What is "the cluster jet beam"? Readers may be confused because the other beams are shown up often. I propose to describe it more precisely. 

A: ‘cluster jet beam’ is replaced with ‘cluster jet’ to eliminate the ambiguity. And a short description of the ‘cluster jet’ is also added in the beginning of the second paragraph

I would propose to put a reference for "The hydrogen cluster jet target was used previously in the ANKE experiment".

A: Implemented.

In the end of the subsection, the luminosity is described. I would propose to mention the beam intensity as well.

A: More details about the COSY beam parameters and the luminosity were added.


2.2. Recoil detector

Figure 2: please don't write an abbreviation "IP" if it is not really necessary. If readers see only the figure, they don't understand it. Readers may not know where the interaction point is. I would propose to rearrange the caption and/or the figure.

A: Implemented. 'IP' is expanded to its full term in Fig. 2.

The importance to have both Si and Ge sensors was not described. Please give brief descriptions.

A: Implemented. The importance of the usage of Si and Ge is added at the end of the first paragraph

What does "Both amplitude and timing signals are extracted from MSCF16 for the energy and time measurement" mean? Are there two signals from the amplifier for measurements of the amplitude and timing? If so, please describe more precisely.

A: The MSCF16 provides one amplitude signal and one timing signal. The two signals are used for energy and time measurement, respectively. The description of this feature has been rephrased in the beginning of the third paragraph.

The authors wrote "Under this condition, the energy resolutions of the silicon and germanium sensors are better than 20 keV and 30 keV (FWHM), respectively", but it induces some questions. Were the resolutions measured in the lab with the alpha source? Is it Am? Please give the resolution more precisely, exact value for at a certain energy. It may be described in sec 5.2, but be more precisely here. Or, just remove this if it is discussed later.

A: Energy resolution numbers are moved to the end of first paragraph of Sec. 5.1. These numbers were obtained using Cm at ~5.8 MeV. 20 keV/30 keV were the average resolution of all strips of the Si/Ge sensors, respectively. They are used to give the reader a sense of the performance of the whole detector.


2.3. Forward detector

In the very beginning of the subsection, it is written "The forward detector consists of 8 detector modules, which are grouped into 4 pairs as shown in Fig. 1". However, I do not find 8 modules and 4 groups in the figure. Please improve the figure or rearrange the sentence.

A: Fig.1 is updated with an inset showing all 8 modules inside the forward chamber.

There are no "+X, -X, +Y and -Y" axes, but you have two axes X and Y. You put those detectors at positive and negative values on those axes. The description must be improved.  

A: ‘+X, -X, +Y, -Y axes’ is modified to ‘X, -X, Y, -Y arms’ and everywhere else in the paper

Why do you use BC-408? It is rather a slow plastic with current techniques. Please justify why you chose the BC-408.

A: Justification of using BC-408 was added to the end of the first paragraph of this section.

The description of the requirement for the forward detector is not given (indeed also for the other detectors". How much time resolution do you require for the development in order to fulfill the requirement in the Koala experiment? Is the deduced time resolution, 360 ps, sufficient enough to fulfill the requirement?

A: Design requirements were added in the first paragraph


3. Data acquisition system

In the first sentence, it is written "The data acquisition system of KOALA is a VME- based system", using "system" twice. Please rephrase the sentence to avoid the repetition. Also the very first sentence in section 2.2.

A:  The beginning of the first paragraph is rewritten to avoid repetition of ‘system’; Event rates measured at COSY and estimated at HESR are added in the first sentence of the first paragraph

The description of the DAQ is given only by the texts, but it may not be easy for readers to follow. I would propose to add a figure to show the scheme of the DAQ system.

A: A DAQ block diagram was added in Fig. 5 (a) as a sub-figure. 

In the second paragraph, the term "+X arm" is used, and I think that it is a proper way to describe the X. -X, Y, -Y. There are for arms but not four axes. Please use this manner in the entire draft.

A: ‘X axis’ was replaced by ‘X arm’ everywhere in the paper

In the end of the fourth paragraph, it is written "However, this method may reduce the DAQ efficiency significantly in a high hit-rate environment". Is it a problem in the KOALA experiment at HESR? Please also describe the requirement for the DAQ in the KOALA experiment at HESR and please discuss if the requirement has been fulfilled or not. If not, please describe how it can be improved.

A: The description about the timestamp based synchronization has been removed, since only a mask gate based synchronization was used in these tests. Timestamp based synchronization was included in the previous draft because we are concerned that high-rate noise triggers may push the DAQ capacity to the limit. In this case, if the noise levels are different in different sub-detectors, a trigger bias may occur between the sub-detectors due to the self-triggering design. This issue actually happened in the beam tests using mask-gate based synchronization. The timestamp based synchronization was proposed initially to solve this issue, since it can improve the DAQ speed significantly and the DAQ will not reach its limit even with high rate noise triggers. Recently, it was found that high-rate noise-induced triggers mainly came from several recoil sensor strips located before the interaction point (i.e. located at physically unreachable region). These noisy strips can be safely removed from the DAQ setup in the future beam commissioning and the mask-gate based synchronization can totally fulfill the experiment’s event rate requirement.


4. Software framework

The components stack of KoalaSoft is shown in Fig.7, however, the description is not given in the text neither in the caption. Please add the description.

A: The second paragraph is rewritten and a short description of each software component in Fig. 7 is added. The component names are in italic form in the texts.


5. Reconstruction

I would propose authors to rearrange this section. I would propose to have another section for calibrations, and this section starts from the clustering. Alignment subsection can also be together with the calibration in the other section.

A: The previous ‘Reconstruction’ was deleted and all subsections excluding ‘Clustering’ are grouped under Sec. 5 with the title ‘Calibration of the recoil detector’. This section is about the calibration of the recoil detector, the titles of the subsections are renamed, i.e.,
     - 5.1 Energy calibration
     - 5.2 Alignment
     - 5.3 Time walk correction
   The ‘Clustering’ subsection is now in Sec. 6


5.3. Clustering

Please provide more quantitative information on how much improvement can be achieved after the clustering, like the peak width, signal-to-background ratio and so on. Having a table for the comparison may also help.

A:  Three characteristics of the energy spectra before and after the clustering are added as Tab. 3. The integral yield within +/- 1 MeV of the peak is only an approximation of the number of actual elastic events, but it gives the reader a sense of the effectiveness of the clustering.


6. Commissioning with proton beam

6.1. Beam condition

The "typical" beam condition is given but not for the dedicated experiment. Please provide the precise information of the beam conditions in the performed experiment.

A: A more specific description of the beam conditions is added in the first paragraph.


7. Conclusion and Outlook

Please clarify if it is ready for the experiment at HESR. If not, please also describe an overview of the global future improvement in addition to some details written in this section.

A: An outlook for KOALA at HESR is also added as the last paragraph
