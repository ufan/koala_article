#+TITLE: The KOALA experiment for (anti)proton-proton elastic scattering

#+TOC: Table of Content

* Introduction
   TODO:
   - reduce reliance on PANDA and LumiDet
   - paper aims to be a stand-alone paper with limited relation to PANDA
   - p-p as a first step at COSY
   - Full setup with LumiDet at HESR
   - The aim of the paper is to be cited later by the Physics paper

   Content list:
   - Summary of (anti)proton-proton elastic scattering research background
   - Short description of PANDA experiment 
     and its requirements on the precision of luminosity measurements.
   - Description of the method of luminosity measurement used in PANDA and the limitation. 
   - More precise differential cross-section data of antiproton-proton elastic scattering covering a large four-momentum transfer range is needed in PANDA energy regime. 
   - A separate experiment called KOALA is proposed to fulfill this specific need.

* Principle of measurement and experiment setup
   TODO:
   - add summary and citation about Target
   - ask Alfons for reference paper about the Target
   
   Principle of measurement:
   - Description of the strategy that KOALA uses to complement LMD.
   - Key parameter requirements in the design

   Overview of the experiment setup.
