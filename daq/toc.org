#+TITLE: The KOALA Experiment for PANDA Luminosity Determination

#+TOC: Table of Content

* Introduction 
   - Short description of PANDA experiment 
     and its requirements on the precision of luminosity measurements.
   - Description of the method of luminosity measurement used in PANDA and the limitation. 
   - More precise differential cross-section data of antiproton-proton elastic scattering covering a large four-momentum transfer range is needed in PANDA energy regime. 
   - A separate experiment called KOALA is proposed to fulfill this specific need.

* Principle of measurement and experiment setup
   Principle of measurement:
