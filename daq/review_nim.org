* General
  - Deadline for revision submission: July 11
  - Point by point
  - Worth publishing but major revision needed
* Major Restructuring
** Select only necessary information to be publish and restructure the paper
*** Rearrange the structure: split section 'Reconstruction' into 'calibration' and 'clustering'
** What is KOALA? What is KOALA's physical goal? What is KOALA's relationship with PANDA?
* Abstract
** Define KOALA experiment more precisely, especially its physical goal
** Rephrase 'better than 30 keV', just write 'approximately 30 keV'
* Introduction
** Rephrase first sentence: 'a good understanding' is not scientific
** TODO Rewrite the first paragraph: Why involving antiproton-proton when the major description is only about proton-proton?
** ANKE and EDDA are not 'recent', rephrase this sentence
** TODO KOALA's relationship with PANDA, in terms of the importance of KOALA. Rewrite the section is proposed by the reviewer.
   The reviewer has made quite some research on KOALA, based on available information on the Internet.
   He has a established view that KOALA is strongly connected with PANDA.
   However, the currrent descriptiono of KOALA as an independent experiment is written on purpose and required by Huagen's strategy.
   *A revision following the reviewer's opinion or stick to the original approach and submit a rebuttal for the revision?*
* Experimental setup at COSY 
** 'setup' VS 'experiment': Do not simply use 'KOALA' alone, but with 'the KOALA setup' or 'the KOALA experiment'
** TODO Add design requirements of the sub-detectors
** 2.1 cluster target
*** More detailed description and explanation of 'cluster jet beam'
*** Add a citation on '...used previously in the ANKE experiment'.
*** Add description about beam intensity and its relationship with luminosity, since luminosity is mentioned in this section
** 2.2 recoil detector
*** TODO Rephrase first sentence: repetition of 'recoil'??
*** Fig. 2: do not use the abbreviation 'IP'
*** Add more description about the importance of using Si and Ge together
*** More precise description about the extracting both amplitude and timing signal from MSCF16. How?
*** TODO More specific and precise description of the resolution or just remove this description entirely to calibration section
    - Results from the lab with alpha sources?
    - Which sources are used and at which energy?
** 2.3 Fwd detector
*** Fig.1: does not show 8 modules of fwd. Find another way of providing this information or rephrase this sentence
*** +X, -X, +Y, -Y 'axes' not correct. Consider using 'arms' instead of 'axes'
*** TODO Justify the selection of BC-408
*** TODO What's the design requirements of Fwd detector? Is the rested result 360 ps sufficient?
* DAQ
** Rephrase first senstence: repetition of 'system'
** TODO Add a figure showing the scheme of the overview of DAQ? Figure from Huagen's drawing??
** TODO Add discussion about the influence of high hit rate to the DAQ efficiency
   - Add the DAQ efficiency requirement
   - Whether this requirement is fullfilled or not
   - How it can be improved
* Fig 7 is shown but no description of the Fig: add description of the component stacks in the text or in the caption
* TODO Split 'Reconstruction'
  - Suggestion of the reviewer: energy calibration and alignment split out as a new section called 'Calibration' and 'Reconstruction' starts from clustering
  - Question: what about time-walk correction?
  - What about clustering split out as separate section and all others as 'Reconstruction'
  - Or energy calibration as 'Calibration' and all others 'Reconstruction'
    
* TODO Clustering: more quantative information on the improvements after clustering
  - Goal of clustering:
    - Correct energy for recoil angle determination, such as alignment and solid angle determination
    - Correct event counts for each channel, which is the correct determination of the entrance position 
  - Why using first hit to calculate the recoil angle instead of the center of gravity?
  - Quetions: How to quantify the clustering performance?
    - Suggested by the reviewer: peak width, SNR, but are these conventional parameters useful?
  
* TODO Provide the precise information of the beam conditions used in the reported beam tests
* TODO Conclusion section: add overview of the current status of KOALA after this experiment
  - Is it ready for the commission in HESR
  - If not, what is needed or planned in the future
* TODO Add acknowledgement
