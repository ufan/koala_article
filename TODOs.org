  CLOSED: [2021-03-02 Tue 09:17]

* TODO Find a description about the lower limit of the dynamic range of recoil energy measurement :work:
  * the lower limit is mainly due to the intrinsic resolution or the electronic noise?
  * up to 60 MeV

* Question: where are the two holes on aluminium wall directed? 

* Question: How is fwd time resolution tested in the lab?
  * two modules are arranged into a cross, then the distribution of time difference deduce the resolution

* Question: Where is the common start for the Start/Stop TDC measurment ?
  * the common trigger: either from one of the recoil sensor or from the fwd

* Question: Explain to Jim about the TDC resolution
  * MTDC32 min. resolution 4 ps, there are other settings like 8ps, 16ps, 32ps .... 32 ps is used in experiment.

* Question: incorrect citation order of SIS 
  * SIS has already been cited by the company, not by module

* Question: DAQ rate performance result and binary data structure 
  * Data structure is defined by EMS, not a work of this paper, we just adopt it
  * DAQ rate can be tested with Pulser, but can't be used as a reference since not random trigger
  * Totally commercial Module, no much sense to characterize them

* TODO Ask Huagen about determination of protection layer thickness of recoil detector
  * My idea: just cite that the thickness has been determined, and the energy loss in calibration and reconstruction is just calculated using LISE++ with difference incidence energy
  * Jim's idea: thickness is determined by comparison of gamma and alpha energy loss, with alpha energy loss from LISE. LISE can't do this without thickness info
  * Huagen's idea: thickness of Si is from other source? Only the ge's thickness is determined by gamma and alpha comparison. And alpha e loss is from measurement

* TODO Redraw Fig.9 and quantify the linearity of ADC, RMS of linear residual or coefficent of x^2 of quardatic fit :work:
  * personal preference: x^2 coefficiency, no need to show the residual
  * sigma of residual: beam gain: 2.9, common gain: 12.1

* TODO Fig.8 think about fit the spectra to get recoil resolution      :work:
  * 20/30 keV comes from previous paper about recoil detector, there has a detailed description about energy resolution
  * personal idea: it's not necessary to fit the spectrum
  * Also, direct fit only gives resolution in ADC channels
  * If really necessary, then ADC should be converted to energy

* Question: Explain the rational of keeping the low-energy background in clustering
  * need the full shape of low-energy spectrum
  * No bias between low-energy and high-energy elastic events

* TODO Explain seed hit to Jim in clustering

* TODO Explain the hit time and hit position determination of clusters to Jim
  * In ideal case, when time-walk is corrected, it does not matter which hit hime is used
  * For the strips where TOF is needed and measured (Si1 & Si2), the hit multiplicity is one, so ...

* Question: description of MIP in clustering, is it a duplicate with the Fit components description 

* TODO Ask Huagen about the precision of laser-poistioning system.
  * laser positioning system vs laser based survey device
  * Name of 'laser positioning system'

* TODO Explain to Jim about offset value in alignment

* TODO Question: about beam condition section
  * Meaning of the comment "Do we need a section "'
  * what's the beam intensity of COSY
  * Explain the beam cycle structure, especially the 40s injection time: Do we really need it?
  * ', which' meaning?
    
* TODO Add description of 40s injection time                           :work:
  
* TODO How did Jim define coincidence?
  * caption of Fig. 18 about the grey area: they are from TOF-E selection
  * elastic events from the edge still have the correct coincidence 

* DONE Fig.18 in comparison with Fig.3 description.
  CLOSED: [2021-03-04 Thu 10:14]
  * Is it a duplicate of information?
  * Correct description of Fig.18 (a)

* DONE min |t|: 0.0008 is the design value, 0.0007 is the deduced from data analysis (350 keV)
  CLOSED: [2021-03-04 Thu 10:14]

* TODO Conclustion section                                             :work:
  * The target thickness effect is slightly discussed in Fig. 18 (a)
  * Prefer not talking about the detail about target profile determination in this article
    * The result is not finalized
    * and may need peer-review or admission from Alfon
    * The contents should be in another paper purely about data analysis

* DONE Add description about multi-strip readout and its fit model
  CLOSED: [2021-03-04 Thu 10:14]

* Sec. 5.4 Peak energy used in the Alignment
  
  * Peak energy is from the fit results using the extraction model described in the results section (Sec. 6)

* Sec. 6.2 Fwd Timing resolution in beam test
  * 140 is sigma, 400 is FWHM. I change 140 to 360 to keep them consistent

* Sec. 6.2 About Fwd SNR
  * Two factors:
    * Mainly due to the pedestal width: sigma = 4 channels in the lab test comparing to 6 in beam test
    * The minor contribution is the voltage applied to PMT is not exactly the same, but this is just a small factor, the lower limits of the MIP peak are almost identical (between 1000 to 1020)

* Sec. 7 about the source of the unexpected thickness of target beam profile
  * It's put here because the source is not identified yet, and the tilting of the target and the beam emittance is just one possibility. So I think it's more suitable to be put in the conclusion and outlook section.
